# Retrans
_A cross-platform application designed make all communications accessible by helping people retransmit their intent._

## What
Humans have many ways of communicating with each other, such as speaking, writing, gesturing, drawing, and so on. Each form of communication has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the context, the purpose, and the audience. Communication is not only about sending a message, but also about receiving and understanding it. That's why retransmitting communication is important.

Retransmitting communication means repeating, summarizing, or clarifying what someone else has said or written, to make sure that the message is clear and accurate. Retransmitting communication can help avoid misunderstandings, conflicts, and errors. It can also show respect and interest in the other person's point of view. Retransmitting communication is a skill that can be learned and practiced in different situations, such as conversations, meetings, presentations, emails, and so on.

For example, when you retransmit what your friend has told you about their feelings or problems, you are showing that you care and that you want to help. This can strengthen your friendship and make you both feel happier and more supported. Retrans is designed to help you feel closer to the world around you by breaking down communication barriers whenever possible.

### What does "retrans" mean?

Retrans is slang for "_retransmission_", primarily used in long-distance radio communications. A retransmission site for radio operators is a location where one or more radios are set up to relay or amplify radio signals from one point to another. This can help extend the range and coverage of radio communications, especially in areas with obstacles or interference. A retransmission site can also be used to link different radio networks that operate on different frequencies.

# Why
After becoming disabled, I realised there's a major gap in product quality and availability for disabled folks. While I need this for myself, that also means that others will absolutely need this, too.

Retrans is designed to help me communicate with the world around me more effectively. It should be able to help you, too. This is also why Retrans is licensed via [AGPL-3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License). Accessibility needs to be for everyone, and the license prevents innovations from happening in closed doors.

# When
Retrans is under active development, and is currently going through prototyping. Follow, star, or watch in order to get the latest and greatest of when releases are coming, what's covered where, and how to use the app.

# Where
Retrans will be supported everywhere .NET MAUI is supported.

* Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher
* iOS 11 or higher
* macOS 10.15 or higher
* Windows 11 and Windows 10 version 1809 or higher

Currently, I am focusing on Android & iOS as the initial distribution sources. I am verifying functionality works on macOS, but I don't have a Windows machine anymore and can't test Windows.

# Who

Retrans is designed and led by me, but all contributions are welcome!
